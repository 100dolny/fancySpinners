# project: fancySpinners

Fancy spinners for every website.
Easy to installation and mantaining

## Usage

### 1. Download spinners.css (or minified version) from /dist/ catalog.
```
https://github.com/kamilrogala/fancySpinners/tree/master/dist
```

### 2. Add this CSS file to your project.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="spinners.min.css">
```

### 3. Type in your HTML chosen spinner like this.
```
<div class="spinner spinner-10"></div>
```

### 4. If you would like other color just add color class.
```
<div class="spinner spinner-10 red "></div>
```

At this time you can choose color classes: red, green, yellow, orange and purple. Default color palette is blue, and it works without any color class.

### 5. If there is no color- you can modify CSS file as you want or override styles in your own CSS file.

### 6. P.S I love pull requests and new ideas ;)
